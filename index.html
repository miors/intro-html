          Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species
          are currently recognised: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta
          africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian
          elephant (Elephas maximus). They are the only surviving members of the
          family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives
          include mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants
          include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps,
          pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is
          prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects.
          Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons
          and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps
          assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in
          communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs,
          whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.

          Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and
          Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including
          savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and
          they stay near water when it is accessible. They are considered to be
          keystone species, due to their impact on their environments. Elephants
          have a fissionâ€“fusion society, in which multiple family groups come
          together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups,
          which can consist of one female with her calves or several related
          females with offspring. The leader of a female group, usually the
          oldest cow, is known as the matriarch.
        </div>
        <div class="item3">
          Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty and
          may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with
          family groups when looking for a mate. They enter a state of increased
          testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain
          dominance over other males as well as reproductive success. Calves are
          the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their
          mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years
          in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound;
          elephants use infrasound and seismic communication over long
          distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of
          primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness, and
          possibly show concern for dying and dead individuals of their kind.
        </div>
        <div class="item4">
          African bush elephants and Asian elephants are listed as endangered
          and African forest elephants as critically endangered by the
          International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). One of the
          biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the
          animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild
          elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people.
          Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past, they were
          used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in
          zoos, or employed for entertainment in circuses. Elephants have an
          iconic status in human culture, and have been widely featured in art,
          folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.
